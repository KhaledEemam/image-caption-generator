# Image-caption-generator

## Overview
This is an image caption generator that allows users to get captions for their images. The model was trained on the Flicker_30k dataset using VGG16 
to preprocess the images and various text preprocessing techniques to preprocess the captions.


## Inference
I Used both greedy and beam search algorithms in inference, Also builded a simple UI to display the model preformance, Inference video can be found through this link :
